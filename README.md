### The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated machine learning model that can detect network anomalies with high accuracy. The model will be designed to consider various factors such as network traffic, system logs, and other relevant data, to provide a comprehensive understanding of network behavior. This is a crucial step towards ensuring the security and stability of network systems.
